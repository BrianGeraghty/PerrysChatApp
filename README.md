# PerrysChatApp

Imagine we are making a private messaging service for our new company Perryâ€™s Summer Vacation Goods and Services. We need you to design and create a scalable API to be able to handle the many messages this company is going to handle.
 
Develop an application meeting the following requirements:
The application must be able to create users. 
The application must allow users to send a message to another user.
The application must allow editing and deleting messages.
The application must allow a user to "like" a message.
The application must be able to get a list of other users that have sent or received messages to/from a specified user.
The application must be able to get all the messages sent between two users.
 
Technical requirements:
Use what language you are comfortable with, but Typescript, Javascript, Java preferred.
The source code must be shared in a public repository (Github, Bitbucket, etc).
The system should be able to scale to 200 requests per second efficiently.
The application should be ready to run in the cloud or in a container (You can use any technology available in AWS).
The application data must be persisted in a database of some type.
